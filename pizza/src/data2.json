			"category": "Family Dinner",
			"description": "Konkan is a strip of land on the Western coast of India encompassing parts of Goa, Karnataka, and Maharashtra. In developing this recipe, I consulted a Konkani family friend, Sandhya Nadkarni, who offers Indian cooking classes and runs the blog Indfused. Sandhya explained that while Konkani recipes are generally diverse in flavors and textures, some fundamental commonalities do exist. Because of its tropical climate, Konkani people (those native to the Konkan region) often cook with coconut, chilies, and tamarind.",

			"description": "Chantilly cream is a sweetened whipped cream flavored with anything from vanilla to bourbon. Making perfectly whipped cream takes more patience than you might think. Some folks just turn the speed up to high and then end up with either a curdled mess en route to butter or whipped cream that deflates on your plate like melted ice cream. Perfectly whipped cream is not grainy, and it has a nice shine to it when dolloped onto the plate. For best results, chill the bowl for at least 15 minutes before whipping the cream, which helps the cream whip faster.",
